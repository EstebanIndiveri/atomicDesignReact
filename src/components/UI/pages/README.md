## ATOMIC DESIGN ðŸ”¬

<hr/>
<div style="text-align:justify; margin-top:30px">
<p >Atomic Design is a methodology used to create web designs. This principle is based on the concept of first creating elements and then putting them together to make sense for the user.</p>

<p> <i>The basic idea is that a website is build from scratch without designing all the pages separately</i></p>
<p>The need for some kind of a design system appears when we start to get overwhelmed by the count of components on a project.</p>

<p>
The five stages of atomic design are:
<ul>
<li>Atoms</li>
<li>Molecules</li>
<li>Organisms</li>
<li>Templates</li>
<li><a href="#Pages">Pages</a></li>
<ul>

<div style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold">Pages are specific instances of templates that show what a UI looks like with real representative content in place, like, so pour representative text, images, and media into the template to show real content in action.</p>
<p>The page stage is the most concrete stage of atomic design, and itâ€™s important for some rather obvious reasons. After all, this is what users will see and interact with when they visit your experience. This is what your stakeholders will sign off. And this is where you see all those components coming together to form a beautiful and functional user interface.
</p>
<p>
We must create systems that establish reusable design patterns and also accurately reflect the reality of the content weâ€™re putting inside of those patterns.
</p>
<div>
<p> Pages are also the place to test variations in templates. For example, you might want to articulate what a headline containing 40 characters looks like, but also demonstrate what 340 characters looks like. What does it look like when a user has one item in their shopping cart versus 10 items with a discount code applied? Again, these specific instances influence how we loop back through and construct our system.</p>

    <li>Homepage</li>
    <li>Final interface</li>

  <p>look our project example about atomic design, just add content and render a template, check out the storybook and examples, let's try now</p>
