## ATOMIC DESIGN 🔬

<div style="text-align:justify; margin-top:30px">
<p >Atomic Design is a methodology used to create web designs. This principle is based on the concept of first creating elements and then putting them together to make sense for the user.</p>

<p> <i>The basic idea is that a website is build from scratch without designing all the pages separately</i></p>
<p>The need for some kind of a design system appears when we start to get overwhelmed by the count of components on a project.</p>

<p>
The five stages of atomic design are:
<ul>

<li>Molecules</li>
<li>Organisms</li>
<li>Templates</li>
<li>Pages</li>

## STORY BOOK 📘

#### What is Storybook?

<div style="text-align:justify; margin-top:30px">

Storybook is a JavaScript tool that allows developers to create organized UI systems making both the building process and documentation more efficient and easier to use.

<p>
Once you build out a component, Storybook lets you create a "story" file where you can then import your component and create various use case examples in an iFramed sandbox using that component.
<br/>
This provides an organized and focused environment to build new components and work on existing ones.
</p>
Starting up Storybook
So now we're ready to get moving! Finally, run:

```
yarn storybook
or
npm run storybook
```

And once everything finishes loading, Storybook will open a new tab in your browser and you should now see a welcome message inside of your new Storybook dashboard!
